# Introduction #
A smal collection of scripts i have used over time which can be nice to have in your toolbelt!

### Commands ###

## perm ##
![perm](https://github.com/seyo-IV/PowerShell-Power-User-Module/blob/main/images/fgrep.png)
Lists NTFS permissions.

## id ##
![id](https://github.com/seyo-IV/PowerShell-Power-User-Module/blob/main/images/id.png)
I tried to make a Linux "id" command but the PowerShell way :D. AD not tested, but should work, sadly i dont have AD at home :(.

## touch ##
![touch](https://github.com/seyo-IV/PowerShell-Power-User-Module/blob/main/images/touch.png)
For the lazy of us.

## top ##
![top](https://github.com/seyo-IV/PowerShell-Power-User-Module/blob/main/images/top.png)
Not even close to the original but stil nice.

## fgrep ##
![fgrep](https://github.com/seyo-IV/PowerShell-Power-User-Module/blob/main/images/fgrep.png)
"f" stand for file, since you only can use that on plain text files and not like the normal grep, where you could filter after executing "ps"(for example).
